require "meta_events"

# An ::MetaEvents::Definition::Event is the lowest level of the MetaEvents DSL. It belongs to a Category (which, in turn,
# belongs to a Version), and should represent a single, consistent "thing that happened" that you want to track.
# The name of an Event must be unique within its Category and Version.
#
# The definition of "single, consistent" depends very much on your context and the scope of what you're tracking,
# and will require significant judgement calls. For example, if your event is +:signup+ (in category +:user+), and
# you change from a lengthy, complex, demanding signup process to Facebook signup -- with an optional form of all the
# lengthy information later -- is that the same event? It depends greatly on how you think of it; you could keep it
# the same event, or introduce a new +:simple_signup+ event -- it depends on how you want to track it.
